#Basic Go Server
This is an exercise in learning a new language (Go, in this case) through building a basic web server. I'll be updating this README as I progress.

##Features
* Basic text landing page
* Can accept user inputs through '/login'
* Can determine whether inputs entered by the user are valid
* Connects to a PostgreSQL databae
* Fully docker-ized with Docker Compose
* Testing harness on utility packages

##File Structure
* **login.gtpl**: HTML template for login page/form
* **basic_server_go.go**: main package
* **basic_server_go**: compiled binary
* See other repos for information about associated utility packages. TODO: Add links
